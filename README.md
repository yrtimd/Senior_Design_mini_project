# Senior_Design_mini_project
Hello! This is the repository for the CE Senior Design Mini Project, written by Jack Halberian and Dmitri Zimin.
## Setting up the project
If you haven't done so already, you can download the project by either cloning the repository locally, or downloading the .zip of the project.
Once you have done this, you will need to install several things:
1. Install node.js. The link for the latest release can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/
Make sure when you install node.js that you also install npm.
2. Install expo-cli. On Windows open Powershell, or on macOS open terminal.
Type the following and hit enter: npm install --global expo-cli
This will install the Expo CLI on your machine.
3. Install Expo Go app.
On either an iOS or Android device, install the Expo Go app.
This will allow you to run the app on your phone for testing.
4. In Powershell or Terminal, simply run npm start.
This will run the app and give you a QR code which you can scan with either the default camera app on iOS or a QR scanner app on Android.
Once this QR code is scanned, the app will load on Expo Go on your mobile device, and you can begin testing!
